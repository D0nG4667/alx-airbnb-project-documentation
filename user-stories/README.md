# 🧩 Convert Use Case Diagram to User Stories

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this task is to **translate the interactions** from the use case diagram into **user stories** that describe how different users interact with the Airbnb Clone backend.
Each user story outlines a feature from the user’s perspective — describing *who* the user is, *what* they want to do, and *why* they need it.

## 🧠 What Are User Stories?

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the user.
They help bridge the gap between **system design (use case diagrams)** and **functional implementation** by focusing on *user goals* instead of technical details.

**Format:**

> As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action] so that I can [achieve a goal].

## 🏗️ Source

These user stories are derived from the **use case diagram** created in Task 1, which visualizes interactions between:

* **Guests**
* **Hosts**
* **Admins**
* **System (Automated actions)**

---

## 📄 Deliverables

1. A Markdown file named **`user-stories.md`** located in the `user-stories/` directory.
2. The file must contain at least **five user stories** representing the most important system interactions, such as:

   * User registration and authentication
   * Property listing and management
   * Booking creation and cancellation
   * Payment processing
   * Review and communication between users
