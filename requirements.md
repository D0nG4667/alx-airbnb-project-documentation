# 📋 Airbnb Clone Backend Requirements (Production-Grade)

## 🎯 Objective

This document provides **comprehensive technical and functional requirements** for the Airbnb Clone backend.
It includes **API endpoints, input/output specifications, validation rules, performance criteria, security measures, and architectural guidance** to ensure a **scalable, secure, and production-ready system**.

## 🧩 Key Backend Features

### 1. User Authentication & Authorization

**Endpoints:**

* `POST /users/register` – Register a new user
* `POST /users/login` – Authenticate a user
* `POST /users/refresh-token` – Refresh JWT token
* `GET /users/{user_id}` – Retrieve user profile
* `PUT /users/{user_id}` – Update user profile

**Input/Output Specifications:**

* **Register:**

  * Input: `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `password`, `role` (guest/host)
  * Output: `user_id`, JWT token, success message
* **Login:**

  * Input: `email`, `password`
  * Output: JWT token, refresh token, user details

**Validation Rules:**

* Email must be unique and properly formatted
* Password: min 8 chars, include letters, numbers, special characters
* Role must be `guest` or `host`

**Security Measures:**

* Password hashing using **bcrypt/argon2**
* JWT access token (short-lived) + refresh token
* Account lockout after **5 failed login attempts**
* Rate limiting: max **5 login attempts per minute per IP**

**Performance Criteria:**

* Login response < 200ms
* Registration < 250ms

### 2. Property Management

**Endpoints:**

* `POST /properties` – Create a property listing
* `GET /properties` – Retrieve all properties (with pagination & filtering)
* `GET /properties/{property_id}` – Retrieve property details
* `PUT /properties/{property_id}` – Update property
* `DELETE /properties/{property_id}` – Delete property

**Input/Output Specifications:**

* Input: `name`, `description`, `location`, `price_per_night`, `amenities`, `availability`
* Output: `property_id`, status message

**Validation Rules:**

* Price must be positive decimal
* Name, location, and description cannot be empty
* Host must exist and be verified

**Security & Performance:**

* Only the host who owns the property can modify or delete it
* Property searches cached in Redis for **frequent queries**
* Pagination limit: 50 per page

**Async Operations:**

* Upload property images → background job
* Notify subscribed users on new property → async notification

### 3. Booking System

**Endpoints:**

* `POST /bookings` – Create booking
* `GET /bookings/{booking_id}` – Retrieve booking
* `PUT /bookings/{booking_id}` – Update status (confirmed/canceled/completed)
* `DELETE /bookings/{booking_id}` – Cancel booking

**Input/Output Specifications:**

* Input: `property_id`, `user_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `total_price`
* Output: `booking_id`, status, total price

**Validation Rules:**

* Start and end dates must be valid and in the future
* Prevent overlapping bookings via **DB-level transactions**
* Total price = `price_per_night * number_of_nights`

**Security & Integrity:**

* Only the booking owner or host can modify or cancel bookings
* Booking creation is **atomic** to prevent double-booking

**Async Operations:**

* Send email/SMS confirmations via background tasks
* Trigger payment process asynchronously

**Performance Criteria:**

* Booking creation < 250ms
* Availability check < 150ms

---

### 4. Payment Integration

**Endpoints:**

* `POST /payments` – Create payment for a booking
* `GET /payments/{payment_id}` – Retrieve payment status
* `POST /payments/webhook` – Receive payment provider notifications

**Input/Output Specifications:**

* Input: `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `currency`
* Output: `payment_id`, status (`pending`, `success`, `failed`)

**Validation & Security:**

* PCI DSS compliant
* Tokenize card data; never store raw card info
* Retry logic with **idempotency keys** to prevent double payments
* Payment callback verification

**Async Operations:**

* Notify user and host upon payment success/failure

---

### 5. Reviews & Ratings

**Endpoints:**

* `POST /reviews` – Create review
* `GET /reviews/{property_id}` – Retrieve all reviews for a property
* `PUT /reviews/{review_id}` – Update review
* `DELETE /reviews/{review_id}` – Delete review

**Validation Rules:**

* Only guests who completed a booking can leave a review
* Rating must be integer between 1 and 5

**Async Operations:**

* Notify host when new review is posted

---

### 6. Messaging & Notifications

**Endpoints:**

* `POST /messages` – Send message to another user
* `GET /messages/{user_id}` – Retrieve user messages
* `GET /notifications/{user_id}` – Retrieve notifications

**Async Operations:**

* Use **message queue** (RabbitMQ/Kafka) for email/in-app notifications
* Delivery retry logic

---

## 🏗️ Architectural Considerations

* **Modular Monolith / Microservice Ready**:

  * Domains: Users, Properties, Bookings, Payments, Reviews, Messaging
  * Each domain is self-contained and can evolve into a microservice

* **Database**:

  * PostgreSQL relational database
  * Enforce foreign keys, indexes, and constraints
  * Use transactions for critical workflows

* **Caching & Performance**:

  * Redis for frequently queried data (search results, property listings)
  * Async background jobs for heavy operations (emails, image processing)

* **Error Handling & Observability**:

  * Standardized error format: `{ code, message, details }`
  * Logging in structured JSON
  * Metrics & alerts for key operations

* **Security & Compliance**:

  * Encrypted sensitive data at rest and in transit
  * Rate limiting, firewalls, and brute-force protection
  * Role-based access control (RBAC) for endpoints

## ✅ Summary

This document outlines **production-grade technical and functional requirements** for the Airbnb Clone backend.
It ensures **security, scalability, modularity, and operational observability**, making it suitable for **real-world deployment** while remaining adaptable for future microservices architecture.
