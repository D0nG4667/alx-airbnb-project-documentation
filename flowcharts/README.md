# üîÑ Backend Process Flowchart

## üéØ Objective

The objective of this task is to **map the workflow and processes** of a key backend feature within the Airbnb Clone backend.
This helps visualize the **sequence of steps, decision points, and data flow** for core operations such as **user registration** or **property booking**.

---

## üß† Description

Flowcharts provide a **step-by-step representation** of a process, showing:

* **Inputs:** Data or actions from users or other systems
* **Processing Steps:** Backend logic, validations, or automated actions
* **Decision Points:** Conditional branches (e.g., booking availability check)
* **Outputs:** Responses, confirmations, or updates to databases

For this example, we have mapped the **User Registration Process**.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Example Flow

1. User submits registration form
2. System validates input data

   * If invalid ‚Üí return error
   * If valid ‚Üí continue
3. System creates a new user record in the **Users DB**
4. System sends a confirmation email to the user
5. User account is activated and ready to use

> The flowchart visually represents these steps, including validations and notifications.

## ‚úÖ Summary

This flowchart provides a **clear visual guide** of backend processes, helping developers understand the workflow and data handling for critical features.
It also serves as a reference for **API design, testing, and documentation**.
