# üìä Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

## üéØ Objective

The objective of this task is to **visualize the flow of data** within the Airbnb Clone backend using a **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**.
This diagram helps understand how data moves between **users, system processes, and data stores** for key operations such as user registration, property management, bookings, payments, and reviews.

## üß† Description

The DFD illustrates:

* **Data Sources / Inputs:** Guest, Host, Admin interactions
* **Processes:** User authentication, property listing, booking creation, payment processing, review management
* **Data Stores:** Users, Properties, Bookings, Payments, Reviews
* **Outputs / Responses:** Confirmation messages, notifications, reports

This diagram serves as a blueprint for **API design, database interaction, and system logic**.
